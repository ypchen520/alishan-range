# Principle of Recursion

* Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine
* **Each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems**

## Properties

* A simple **base case**
  * terminating scenario
  * recurrence relation
    * a set of rules

## Print a string in reverse order

## Reverse String

### Two-pointer

* in-place

## Recursion Function

* Break the problem down into subproblems
* Call the function recursively to solve the subproblems
* process the results from the recursive function calls (i.e., answers to the subproblems) to solve the overall problem

## Swap Nodes in Pairs (Linked List)

* swap the first two nodes
* swap(head.next.next) to swap the rest of the nodes following the first two nodes
* attach the returned head of the sub-list with the first two nodes

### Iterative

* Use two pointers in the same direction
