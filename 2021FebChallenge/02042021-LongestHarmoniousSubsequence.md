## Description

* We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
* Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
* A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements **without changing the order of the remaining elements**.
