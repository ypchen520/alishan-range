# Number of 1 Bits

## Description

* Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
* Note
  * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
  * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
* Follow up
  * If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

### Bit Manipulation

* Instead of checking every bit of the number, we repeatedly **flip the least-significant 1-bit of the number to 0, and add 1 to the sum. As soon as the number becomes 0, we know that it does not have any more 1-bits, and we return the sum.
* for any number n, **doing a bit-wise AND of n and n - 1 flips the least-significant 1-bit in n to 0**

### Python

* int to binary string
  * bn = f'{n:b}'
