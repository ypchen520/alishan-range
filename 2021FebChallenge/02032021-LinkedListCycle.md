# Linked List Cycle

## Description

* Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it

## Solution

### Hash Table

* we can check whether a node had been visited before
* We go through each node one by one and record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table
* If the current node is null, we have reached the end of the list and it must not be cyclic. If current nodeâ€™s reference is in the hash table, then return true.
* JAVA
  * HashSet
    * The HashSet class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table which is actually a HashMap instance
    * The underlying data structure for HashSet is Hashtable
    * As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed
    * NULL elements are allowed in HashSet
    * HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<String>();
      * Set<String> hs = new HashSet<String>();
      * hs.add("Geek"); 
      * hs.contains("Geek");
* Time complexity: O(n)
  * Adding a node to the hash table costs only O(1) time.
* Space complexity: O(n)
* Python
  * We can use set()
  * set.add()

### O(1) memory

* Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
  * by considering two pointers at different speed - a slow pointer and a fast pointer
  * If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return false in this case.
  * Consider a cyclic list, the fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner.
