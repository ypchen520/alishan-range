# Trim a Binary Search Tree

## Description

* Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
* Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

## Solution

* we need to remove the node and change root of sub-tree rooted with this node
* fix the tree in Postorder fashion
  * left --> right --> root
* When we visit a node, we make sure that its left and right sub-trees are already fixed
  * Node’s key is smaller than the min value: we simply remove root and return right sub-tree as new root.
  * Node’s key is greater that the max value: we remove root and return left sub-tree as new root.
