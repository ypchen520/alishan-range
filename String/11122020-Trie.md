# The data structure Trie (Prefix tree) and most common operations with it
* a tree data structure
* used for retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings
* reasons why Trie outperforms hash table
  * more efficient in the following operations
    * Finding all keys with a common prefix
    * Enumerating a dataset of strings in *lexicographical* order.
# Applications
* Autocomplete
* Spell checker
* IP routing (longest prefix matching)
* T9 predictive text
* Solving word games
# Trie node structure
* a rooted tree
* Its nodes have the following fields
  * Maximum of R links to its children
    *  assume that R is 26, the number of lowercase latin letters
  * Boolean field which specifies whether the node corresponds to 
    * the end of the key, or 
    * is just a key prefix.
# Insertion of a key to a trie
* insert a key by searching into the trie
* start from the root
  * search a link
    * a link exists
    * a link does not exist
      * create a new node and link it with the parent's link matching the current key character
      * repeat this step until we encounter the last character of the key
      * mark the current node as an end node and the algorithm finishes
* Time complexity
  * O(m), where m is the key length
* Space complexity
  * In the worst case, newly inserted key doesn't share a prefix with the keys already in the trie
  * we have to add **m new nodes**
  * O(m) space
# Search for a key(word) in a trie
* Each key is represented in the trie as **a path from root** to the internal node or leaf
* start from root with the first key character
  * examine the current node for a link corresponding to the key character
    * A link exists: we move to the next node
    * A link does not exist: 
      * we return true if current node is marked as **isEnd**
      * There are key characters left, but it is impossible to follow the key path in the trie, and the key is missing.
      * No key characters left, but current node is not marked as isEnd. Therefore **the search key is only a prefix of another key** in the trie.
* Time complexity O(m), where m is the key length
* Space Complexity: O(1)
# Search for a key prefix in a trie
* when we come to an end of the key prefix, we always return true
* We don't need to consider the isEnd mark of the current trie node
* Time complexity O(m), where m is the key length
* Space Complexity: O(1)
# Practice Problems
* Add and Search Word
* Word Search: similar to Boggle
