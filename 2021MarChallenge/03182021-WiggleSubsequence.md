# Wiggle Subsequence

## Description

* Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence.
* A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
  * For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) are alternately positive and negative.
  * In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
* A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
* Follow up: Could you solve this in O(n) time?
