# Remove Palindromic Subsequences

## Description

* Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
* Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
* A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.
* A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

## Solution

### Hint

* Use the fact that string contains only 2 characters.
* Are subsequences composed of only one type of letter always palindrome strings?

### O(n) time complexity

* If given string is palindrome, we need only one removal.
* Else we need two removals. Note that every binary string has all 1’s as a subsequence and all 0’s as another subsequence. We can remove any of the two subsequences to get a unary string. A unary string is always palindrome.
* if isPalindrome
  * res = 1
* else
  * remove all 1's and then all 0's
  * res = 2
