## First Bad Version
* You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
* You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. 
* You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
