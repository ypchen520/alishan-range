## Merge Sorted Array
* The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively
* You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2
* Input
  * nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
  * nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
* **from right to left**
