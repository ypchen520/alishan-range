# Celebrate successes

* just so you know
* hear him out
* I've given it a great deal of thought
* Don't take this the wrong way
* You're being serious
* Is that what this is about?
* get on with it
* tell me about it
* Lay it on me
* Any idea what it might be
* I know we've asked a lot of you
* I'm glad you see it that way
* You haven't gotten attached to anyone, have you?
* you can't be serious
