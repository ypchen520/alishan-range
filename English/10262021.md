# It is better to live our own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life with perfection

* Throw in the towel
  * admit defeat
* balance
* little time
* warm tones and cold tones (colors)
* what do you think you could've done better
* it's gonna catch up to you
* lied a little
* a fan of 
* an open mind
* put it into practice
* make all the difference
* you ended up putting aside
* reading without taling further actions
* full potential
