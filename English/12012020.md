* I noticed that
* things were very different in Denmark from back home in New York City
* Locals seemed more relaxed
* less addicted to their phones, more present with one another
* Streets were quiter
* Shops and restaurants played gentle music **on low volume**
* It's almost as if people there didn't need distractions from their reality
* contentment
