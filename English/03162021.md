# Tiny is mighty

* guide dogs
* at least when it comes to change
* over the last twenty years
* find a job
* get back on track with school
* he'd put on his headphones and play video games with people halfway across the world instead
* financial and emotional support
* never seemed to
* in the worst of times
* he lashed out in anger
* start off with a simple request
