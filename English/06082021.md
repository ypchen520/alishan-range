* This is not unexpected
* I invested my time and energy in developing new skills, solving new problems, acquiring new knowledge, and figuring out ways to enhance my life

* If you fail at something you care about, you can use it as a chance to learn a valuable lesson
* Every situation is an opportunity to grow, especially challenging ones
* I nearly backed out
* If you want to get over your fears, the best thing to do is lean into them
* You're not supposed to do that
