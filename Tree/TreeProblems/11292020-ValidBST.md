## Validate Binary Search Tree
* a BST is defined as follows:
  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# Recursion
* One compares the node value with its upper and lower limits if they are available. 
* Then one repeats the same step recursively for left and right subtrees.
* **helper** function
  * upper and lower limits
* **if(node == null) return true;**
* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(n)
# Iteration
# Inorder traversal
