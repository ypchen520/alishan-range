## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
* Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
## Solution
* Start with **the first item in the preorder sequence**, which is the root
* Other steps are the same as the ones for contructing BT from Postorder and Inorder Traversal
  * except for the case where left subtree should be traversed first
