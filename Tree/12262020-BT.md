## Binary Tree
# Tree
* each node of the tree will have
  * a root value 
  * a list of references to other nodes
    * which are called child nodes
* From **graph** view, a tree can also be defined as 
  * a directed acyclic graph which has
    * N nodes and 
    * N - 1 edges
# Binary Tree
* a tree data structure in which each node has
  * **at most** two children

# Goal
* Understand the concept of a tree and a binary tree
* Be familiar with different traversal methods
* Use **recursion** to solve binary-tree-related problems

## Traverse a Tree
# Pre-order
* visit the root first
* then traverse the left subtree
* finally, traverse the right subtree
# In-order
* left subtree --> root --> right subtree
* For **binary search tree**
  * we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal
# Post-order
* left subtree --> right subtree --> root
* when **deleting** nodes in a tree,
  * deletion process will be in post-order
  * when you delete a node, you delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself
* **mathematical expression**
  * using a stack
  * Each time when you meet a operator, you can just pop 2 elements from the stack, calculate the result and push the result back into the stack.
# Recursive or Iterative
* Recursion is one of the most powerful and frequently used techniques for solving tree problems
* a tree
  * can be defined **recursively** as a node (i.e., the root node) that includes a value and a list of references to children
  * **Recursion is one of the natural features of a tree**
* For each recursive function call
  * we only focus on the problem for the current node and **call the function recursively to solve its children**
* Top-down
  * pass values to child nodes
  * preorder traversal
  * the recursive function ```top_down(root, params)```
    * return specific value for null node
    * update the answer if needed
    * left_ans = top_down(root.left, left_params)
    * right_ans = top_down(root.right, right_params)
    * return the answer if needed 
  * ```maximum_depth(root, depth)```
    * return if root is null
    * if root is a leaf node:
      * answer = max(answer, depth) // update the answer if needed
    * maximum_depth(root.left, depth + 1) 
    * maximum_depth(root.right, depth + 1)
* Bottom-up
  * first call the function recursively for all the child nodes
  * post-order traversal
  * ```bottom_up(root)```
    * return specific value for null node
    * left_ans = bottom_up(root.left) 
    * right_ans = bottom_up(root.right)
    * return answers
* conclusion
  * a tree problem
    * **top down**
      * Can you determine some parameters to help the node know its answer?
      * Can you use these parameters and the value of the node itself to determine what should be the parameters passed to its children?
    * **bottom up**
      * for a node in a tree, if you know the answer of its children, can you calculate the answer of that node?
# Level-order Traversal
* to traverse the tree level by level
* **Breadth-First Search**
  * starts with a root node
  * visits the node itself first
  * then traverse its neighbors
  * traverse its second level neighbors, and so on
  * When we do breadth-first search in a tree, **the order of the nodes we visit is in level order**
  * Typically, we use a **queue** to perform BFS
