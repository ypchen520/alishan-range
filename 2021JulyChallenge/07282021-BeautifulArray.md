## Description

* For some fixed n, an array nums is beautiful if it is a permutation of the integers 1, 2, ..., n, such that:
  * For every i < j, there is no k with i < k < j such that nums[k] * 2 = nums[i] + nums[j].
  * Given n, return any beautiful array nums.  (It is guaranteed that one exists.)
