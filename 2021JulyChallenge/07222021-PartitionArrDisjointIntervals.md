# Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

## Description

* Given an array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
  * Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
  * left and right are non-empty.
  * left has the smallest possible size.
* Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.
