# Introduction to Linked List

* linear data structure
* linked together by **the reference field**
* singly linked list and doubly linked list

## Goals

* Understand the structure
* Implement **traversal, insertion, deletion** in a singly or doubly linked list
* **Analyze the complexity** of different operations in a singly or doubly linked list;
* Use **two-pointer technique** (fast-pointer-slow-pointer technique) in the linked list
* Solve classic problems such as reverse a linked list;

## Singly Linked List

* a reference field
* In most cases, we will use the head node (the first node) to represent the whole list.
* **Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time**
* accessing data by index
  * If we want to get the ith element, we have to **traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index**, where N is the length of the linked list.

## C++

```C++
struct SinglyListNode {
    int val;
    SinglyListNode *next;
    SinglyListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};
```

## Java

```Java
public class SinglyListNode {
    int val;
    SinglyListNode next;
    SinglyListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

## Add Operation (Singly Linked List)

* Add a new value
  * given a node **prev**
  * initialize a new node **cur** with the **given value**
  * link the **next** field of cur to prev's next node **next**
    * cur.next = prev.next
  * link the **next** field in **prev** to **cur**
    * prev.next = cur
  * Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element. 
    * Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in **O(1) time complexity**, which is very efficient.
* Add a Node at the Beginning
  * Initialize a new node cur
    * new cur = ListNode(val);
  * Link the new node to our original head node head. 
    * cur.next = head;
  * Assign cur to head.
    * head = cur

## Delete Operation (Singly Linked List)

* Delete an existing node cur
  * Find cur's previous node **prev** and its next node **next**
  * Link **prev** to cur's next node **next**
    * we have to traverse the linked list from the head node to find out **prev**, which will take **O(N)**
      * The space complexity is O(1)
* Delete the First Node
  * simply **assign the next node to head**
    * head = head.next

## Design Linked List

* all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed

### Solution

* implement a getNode function to traverse the Linked List
* implement a ListNode class to represent a Node
* declare a **size** attribute and a **head** attribute for the LinkedList class
* edge cases
