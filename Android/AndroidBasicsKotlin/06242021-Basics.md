# Basics

## Kotlin

* fun

```Kotlin
fun main(){
    println("")
}
```

* println vs. print
  * the latter has no line break
    * "\n"
* [Vocabulary](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/android-basics-kotlin-vocab)
* val: variable
  * not mutable
* var
  * mutable
* To use a variable inside a print statement: ${VAR}
* repeat()
  * loop

    ```Kotlin
    fun printBorder(border: String, timesToRepeat: Int) {
        repeat(timesToRepeat) {
            print(border)
        }
    }
    ```

## [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

* Gradle sync finished (finished setting up the project)
* Android virtual device (AVD)
* [Run your app on a mobile device](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-run-on-mobile-devi[â€¦]elabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-training-run-on-mobile-device)

## Happy Birthday app

* View
  * TextView: displaying text
* ViewGroup
  * container that is responsible for the Views
  * e.g.
    * ConstraintLayout
* Layout Editor
  * res > layout > activity_main.xml
* [dp vs. sp](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities?authuser=1)
* Resource Manager
  * Import Drawable
* ImageView
* **Hardcoded string "From Yu-Peng", should use @string resource**

### Kotlin(Dice)

* Int, String, **IntRange**
  * val

  ```Kotlin
  val diceRange = 1..6
  val diceRange: IntRange = 1..6
  ```

* IntRange.random()
* Encapsulation: enclose functionality that is logically related into a single place (class)
* **Refactoring**: Changing code to make it shorter, more efficient, or easier to read and understand

### Introduction to Activities

* An Activity provides the window in which your app draws its UI
* Every app has one or more activities.
  * The top-level or first activity is often called the MainActivity
* For more complicated apps, there may be multiple screens and more than one Activity. Each Activity has a specific purpose
  * A photo gallery app
    * GalleryActivity
    * ViewerActivity
    * EditorActivity
* Notice that there is no main() function in your MainActivity
  * Instead of calling a main() function, the Android system calls the onCreate() method of your MainActivity when your app is opened for the first time

### Interactive Button

* val rollButton : Button = findViewById(R.id.button)
  * rollButton.setOnClickListener

#### Update the TextView when the Button is clicked

```Kotlin
val resultTextView: TextView = findViewById(R.id.textView)
resultTextView.text = diceRoll.toString()
```

#### Change the dice image when the button is clicked

### Adopt good coding practices

* Reformat your code
  * With all the text selected in the file, go to the Android Studio menu Code > Reformat Code or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+L (or Command+Option+L on Mac)
* Comment your code

### Control Flow

* The way you guide execution with these conditionals (if-else) is called the "control flow" of the program
* Kotlin: when statement
  * ->
  * similar to switch
  * a when expression can return a value. E.g.,
  
  ```Kotlin
  val drawableResource = when (diceRoll){
    1 -> 
    2 ->
    ...
    else ->
  }
  ```
