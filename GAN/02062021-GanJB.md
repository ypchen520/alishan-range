# A Gentle Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* [Last Updated on July 19, 2019](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)
* GAN is an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods

## Generative modeling

* unsupervised learning
* automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
