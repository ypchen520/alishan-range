# Framing

* how to frame a task as a machine learning problem

## Learning Objectives

* Refresh the fundamental machine learning terms.
* Explore various uses of machine learning.

## [Supervised ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/framing/ml-terminology)

* combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data
* **Label**: the variable we're predicting
* **Features**: input variables describing our data
  * x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ...
* **Example**: a particular instance of data
  * Labeled or unlabeled
* **Model**: maps examples to predicted labels
  * defined by internal parameters, which are learned
* Regression vs. classification
  * regression: predicts continuous value
    * what is the value of a house in California
    * what is the probability that a user will click on this ad
  * classification: predicts discrete values
    * Is a given email message spam or not spam
    * Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster
* Quiz
  * our labels need to derive from objective behaviors like clicks that strongly correlate with user preferences.
