# Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

## Description

* Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.
* From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

## Solution

### [DFS and Memoization](https://sarthak-sehgal.github.io/leetcode101/lc329/)

### Dynamic programming (Top-down)

* 2D matrix dp[][]: store the value of the length of longest increasing path
