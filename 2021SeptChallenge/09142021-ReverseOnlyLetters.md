# Reverse Only Letters

## Description

* Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:
  * All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
  * All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
* Return s after reversing it.

## Solution

### Hint

* This problem is exactly like reversing a normal string except that there are certain characters that we have to simply skip. That should be easy enough to do if you know how to reverse a string using the two-pointer approach.
