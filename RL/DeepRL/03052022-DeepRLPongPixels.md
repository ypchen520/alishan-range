# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels

* Andrej Karpathy

## Four separate factors that hold back AI

* **Compute**: Moore's Law, GPUs, ASICs
* **Data**: ImageNet
* Algorithms: backprop, CNN, LSTM
* **Infrastructure**: Linux, TCP/IP, Git, AWS, TensorFlow

### Deep Q Learning
  * Q Learning with function approximation
    * function approximator: ConvNet
* AlphaGo
  * policy gradients with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
* multiple clever tweaks on top of old algorithms

### Learn to play most ATARI games at human level

* from pixels
* Policy Gradients (PG)
  * better than DQN: end-to-end
