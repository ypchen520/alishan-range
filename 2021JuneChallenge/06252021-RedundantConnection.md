# Redundant Connection

## Description

* In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
* You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
* Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

## Solution

### DFS

```Java
class Solution {
    Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet();
    int MAX_EDGE_VAL = 1000;

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        ArrayList<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[MAX_EDGE_VAL + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= MAX_EDGE_VAL; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList();
        }

        for (int[] edge: edges) {
            seen.clear();
            if (!graph[edge[0]].isEmpty() && !graph[edge[1]].isEmpty() &&
                    dfs(graph, edge[0], edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
    public boolean dfs(ArrayList<Integer>[] graph, int source, int target) {
        if (!seen.contains(source)) {
            seen.add(source);
            if (source == target) return true;
            for (int nei: graph[source]) {
                if (dfs(graph, nei, target)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
