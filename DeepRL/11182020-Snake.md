# Snake

* Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Neural Networks + Q-learning
* Keras n top of Tensorflow
* Pygame
* RL
  * MDP (Markov Decision Process)
  * two main components
    * the environment
    * the agent: **the deep neural network that drives out Snake's actions**
  * Every time the agent performs an action, the environment gives a **reward** to the agent, which can be positive or negative depending on *how good the action was from that specific state*
  * The goal of the agent is to learn what actions maximize the reward, given every possible **state**
  * states
    * the *observations* that the agent receives at each iteration from the environment
    * position, speed, array of variables that *describe the environment*
  * **policy**: the decision-making process that the agent adopts
    * a mapping from the *state* space into the *action* space
      * action space: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT
* Q-table
* Deep Q-Learning
